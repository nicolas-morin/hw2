        According to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight">the World Health Organization</a> 
        <b>Worldwide Obesity has nearly tripled since 1975</b> <br>
        We have been eating way too much and are not taking care of the basics when it comes to Nutrition. <br>
        While many believe that you need to crunch until you die to get abs, it actually stars with proper Nutrition. <br>
        The reason we are confused when it comes to what to eat and what is actually good and bad for you is not our fault.
        <b>Industries and their lobbies have been blurring reality.</b> They’ve been promoting a way of dieting that <b>sabotages our health and well-being. </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They’ve made food cheaper. But they’ve also made it more processed, fattier, with more sugar, and with no nutrients at all. <b>So we’re becoming sicker</b> and spending more on healthcare.

    <h2 class="text-xl text-red-600 mt-4 mb-2">Something is very wrong! </h2>

    <p>
        Studies of various tribal peoples cut off from modern technology have shown that they generally live longer, are healthier, 
        and are free of many diseases we take for granted today <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22262579/">[1]</a> <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/2/341/4607411">[2]</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>The way you eat influences every part of your life</b>. Knowing about nutrition is, therefore, crucial. Understand what you’ve been doing wrong, and getting back to the basics, will allow you to make good choices and reach your goals. <br>
